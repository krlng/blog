My name is Nico Kreiling, a curious, semi-hyperactive guy living in Karlsruhe (Germany). Besides sports and good music I love to explore new, interesting technologies and apply them to real world problems.

I studied industial engineer at the Karlsruher Institute of Technology (KIT) while coding a lot on the side. I started with HTML and CSS in the age of 14 and created a couple of websites in self-dependence. Later I worked as a Frontend developer for [GameForge](https://gameforge.com/) on games such as [ikariam](https://de.ikariam.gameforge.com/). I started doing analytical work in the BI team at [virtual7](http://www.virtual7.de/) in 2013. After finishing my master thesis on a Big Data System to manage geo-temporal car sensordata I started to work at [inovex](https://www.inovex.de/de/) as Big Data Scientist. 

Searching for valueable solutions I like to align my projects to the actual user needs using the Design Thinking methology I practiced for multiple years at the [Karlsruher Reasearch Institute](https://www.ksri.kit.edu/). Furthermore I lived in South Africa and Istanbul, organized youth camps and love to travel. For more technical information check out my other posts and GitHub Projects or reach out to me on the socials.
